More wearable hardware is becoming available in 2014. Therefore, Dan Scott and a few GDG managers [sat together](https://plus.google.com/+DanScottCAN/posts/h3dfS1dCwwG) to plan activities around 
wearables during the summer of 2014.

## Wearable Hardware

Google announced Android Wear OS on [18 March 2014](http://android-developers.blogspot.be/2014/03/android-wear-developer-preview.html), 
Intel announced the [Edison developer board](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html), ideas around 
devices that user want to wear on their body, on their wrist, on their head. During this summer, we want to develope on and for these devices. 


## Call for participation

We invite all community managers to join this activity. The main goal is to share information and knowledge and to plan 
events together. If you are interested please send a pull request at github with your community/city.

Fork the repos at [github](https://github.com/SummerOfWearables/summerofwearables.github.com)

Then create a page for your community. You can use 
```
rake page name="community/your_city_or_group_name"
```

The directory structure is then
```
.
|-- community
    |-- your_city_or_group_name
        |-- index.html
```

The page should contain 
  * the name of the community and 
  * a link to a G+ page, community or to a website. 

See e.g. [GDG Brussels](/community/gdg-brussels)

Commit your page and send the pull request!
